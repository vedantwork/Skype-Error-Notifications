Redis integration in django


In terminal, paste the following command prompt or vs code terminal


pip install django-redis
sudo apt install redis-tools


After the following command you need to start your service by the following command


sudo service redis-server start


To Stop redis server
sudo service redis-server stop


  



In your project, open setting file and paste the following 
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
        "LOCATION": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
        }
    }
}
Because using import cache by 
from django.core.cache import cache


you can just run the following command and you will see all databases of the Redis instance without firing up redis-cli
redis-cli INFO | grep ^db
  











Redis API List


setdata
In setdata(), when the user hits any specific api the response comes for the server and gets stored into the cache, on the second time when the api is hit the data will come from the cache instead of the server

{"key":"hellooo",”value”:”(Json content)”}
 
getdata
In getdata() the api response will come from the store cache instead of the server, which will indirectly reduce the response time

In deletedata() the cache will get deleted as soon as the user clicks on view report button or calls /restapi/report/getreportdata/ api
